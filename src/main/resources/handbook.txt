# ACME TECH CORP - OFFICIAL EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK 2026

## 1. MISSION & CULTURE
Our mission is to automate the mundane. We value "Extreme Ownership" and "Async First" communication.
- We don't have "stand-ups"; we have "Slack-ups" where you post your status by 10:00 AM EAT.
- If a meeting has no agenda, you are legally allowed (and encouraged) to skip it.

## 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK & ACCESS
- Core Backend: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.
- Databases: PostgreSQL (Primary), MongoDB (Orders), Qdrant (Search).
- Infrastructure: All services run on AWS EKS.
- VPN: You must use 'AcmeSafe-VPN' to access the staging environment.
- Onboarding Task #1: Clone the 'order-service' repo and run './mvnw install'.

## 3. HR & ADMINISTRATIVE
- Payroll: Salaries are processed on the 25th of every month.
- Expenses: Use the 'Expensify' app for anything under $50 without prior approval.
- Leave: We have an "Unlimited PTO" policy, but we require a minimum of 15 days taken per year to prevent burnout.
- Working Hours: We are flexible, but core collaboration hours are 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM EAT.

## 4. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
- Never commit plain-text passwords. Use AWS Secrets Manager.
- All code must pass the SonarQube "Quality Gate" before a PR can be merged.
- 2FA is mandatory for all internal tools.

## 5. THE FIRST 30 DAYS ROADMAP
- Day 1-3: Hardware setup, VPN access, and intro calls with your 'Onboarding Buddy'.
- Week 1: Push your first "documentation-only" PR to get used to the CI/CD pipeline.
- Month 1: Take ownership of one minor bug fix in the 'order-service'.
